### 📄 Page 3: Price Forecasting with ML & Statistical Models

![Page 2 - Forecast](images/page3.png)

This page contains **two forecasting models**, implemented directly within Power BI using **R and Python scripts**:

- 🔹 **Left Chart**:  
  Forecast of total **cryptocurrency market capitalization** using the **ARIMA model** in **R**. The shaded blue zone represents the **forecast interval**, capturing prediction uncertainty.

- 🔹 **Right Chart**:  
  **Bitcoin price prediction** using a **Random Forest** regression model scripted in **Python**.  
  - **Black Line**: Actual BTC price  
  - **Blue Line**: Predicted BTC price  
  This model uses historical features to learn BTC trends and forecast future prices.

> ✅ The use of **embedded R and Python scripts** within Power BI allows dynamic forecasting and seamless integration of machine learning insights directly into visual reports.
